# Open/R CLI: `breeze`

`breeze` is a [python click](https://pypi.org/project/click/) based CLI tool to
query Open/R's state. It allows you to inspect many components of Open/R. This
includes:

- Link state database
- Advertised prefix database
- Links discovered by Open/R
- Neighbors
- Computed routes along with Loop-Free Alternates
- Programmed routes in FIB
- Set/Unset overload bit for node and links or custom metrics on links
- Add/Del/Modify keys in KvStore

## How it Works

---

All Open/R modules expose various Thrift APIs to access their internal state
over TCP transport. Open/R has
[python based clients](https://github.com/facebook/openr/tree/master/openr/py/openr/clients)
for each module which Breeze leverages to talk to Open/R, retrieve information,
and display it

## How to use `breeze`

---

Breeze is very intuitive to use. Just do `--help` at any stage to see options,
arguments, and subcommands. Later sections cover about each command in detail.

```console
$ breeze --help
...
  bgp           Show BGP Information
  config        CLI tool to peek into Config Store module.
  decision      CLI tool to peek into Decision module.
  fib           CLI tool to peek into Fib module.
  kvstore       CLI tool to peek into KvStore module.
  lm            CLI tool to peek into Link Monitor module.
  monitor       CLI tool to peek into Monitor module.
  openr         CLI tool to peek into Openr information.
  perf          CLI tool to view latest perf log of each module.
  prefixmgr     CLI tool to peek into Prefix Manager module.
  spark         CLI tool to peek into Spark information.
  tech-support  Extensive logging of Open/R's state for debugging
```

### Sub Commands

Each of the above list of terms is a subcommand. You can get futher information
about each by asking for help on that specific subcommand.

```console
$ breeze decision --help
Usage: breeze decision [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  CLI tool to peek into Decision module.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  adj                   dump the link-state adjacencies from Decision module
  path                  path from src to dst
  received-routes       Show routes this node is advertising.
  rib-policy            Show currently configured RibPolicy
  routes                Request the routing table from Decision module
  routes-computed       Request the routing table from Decision module
  validate              Check all prefix & adj dbs in Decision against that...
```

The submodule themselves then have subcommands to do different interactions with
that Open/R module.

Please refer to the [Protocol Guide](../Protocol_Guide/index.rst) for more
information about each Open/R module.

### Bash Autocompletion

To get auto-completion in your bash shell, simply copy
`eval "$(_BREEZE_COMPLETE=source breeze)"` to your `~/.bashrc`.

### Remote Connecting

`breeze` can remote connect to a device to run a command. This is due to thrift
being a TCP/IP protocol and Open/R (by default) listening on all interfaces.
Please note, firewalls etc. can block this from working.

```console
$ breeze -H rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net decision adj
> rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net

## Debugging Open/R with `breeze`

`breeze` can be daunting as it has so many sub-commands. This section attempts
to walk through debugging Open/R modules in an order that makes sesnse due to
the dependencies on one another. For example, we can not have an Prefixes in the
FIB if Decision's RIB has no learnt prefixes from neighbors to program.

### Is Open/R alive and running?

First thing's first, is Open/R running and ready to function? We can check this
by seeing if the Open/R Thrift server is responding. To check this you can use:

```console
breeze -H rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net openr version

```

### Run sanity checks to try and narrow down the issue

The command `breeze openr validate` will run a series of sanity checks for each
module, and report additional information in the case of failure. Specific
information about each check can be found in the `Validation` section of each
sub command.

Example with everything passing:

```console
$ breeze openr validate

Total Neighbors: 96, Neigbors in ESTABLISHED State: 96, Neighbors in Other States: 0
[Spark] Initialization Event Check: PASS

### What interfaces is Open/R configured to perform neighbor discovery over?

Lets see what interface(s) Open/R is _trying_ to form adjacencies on:

```console
breeze -H rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net lm links
Certificate will not expire

== Node Overload: NO  ==

### Who has Open/R formed adjacencies with?

Lets see if we have an adjacency on each link we expect:

```console
$ breeze -H rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net decision adj

```

- _Please note:_ Forming an adjacency (adj) is a _neighbor_ adjacency in Open/R
  - Similiar concept to BGP Peering

### What routes do we have in our RIB?

Open/R takes all routes from neigbors (after applying policy) and stores them in
the RIB. If there is **no** routes in the RIB, the FIB can have no Open/R
routes. So it makes sense to see if there is anythig in the RIB before looking
at the FIB.

```console
$ breeze -H rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net decision routes
== Unicast Routes for rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net  ==

> 0.0.0.0/0

  via 10.204.71.44%fboss4001 weight 1
...
```

### What routes have made it to the FIB?

After confirming we have route(s) in the RIB, lets see if what has made it to
the FIB makes sense!

```console
== Unicast Routes for rsw023.p008.f01.vll2.tfbnw.net  ==

> 0.0.0.0/0
  via 10.120.71.44%fboss4005 weight 1

  via 10.121.71.44%fboss4006 weight 1
  via 10.206.71.44%fboss4003 weight 1
  via 10.123.71.44%fboss4008 weight 1
  via 10.204.71.44%fboss4001 weight 1

> 10.110.161.11/32
  via 10.120.71.44%fboss4005 weight 1
  via 10.207.71.44%fboss4004 weight 1
  via 10.122.71.44%fboss4007 weight 1
  via 10.205.71.44%fboss4002 weight 1
  via 10.121.71.44%fboss4006 weight 1
  via 10.206.71.44%fboss4003 weight 1
  via 10.123.71.44%fboss4008 weight 1
  via 10.204.71.44%fboss4001 weight 1
...
```

By going through all these steps we have checked:

- Open/R is running
- Where it's trying to form adjacencies
- Current Adjacencies
- Current RIB entries
- Current FIB entries

## Module Specific `breeze` Examples

### KvStore Commands

#### Nodes

You can identify all nodes in a network based on the content of KvStore.

```console
$ breeze kvstore nodes

Node     V6-Loopback            V4-Loopback

#### Prefix/Adjacency Database

Each node announces to the KvStore an Adjacency database, modeled as a list of
neighbors, and a Prefix database, the list of prefixes announced from that node.
Since every node has the same content in its KvStore (you can think of it as an
eventually consistent distributed database), each node has global knowledge of
the network.

By default `prefixes` and `adj` KvStore commands will show information for local
node only unless specified with `--nodes=all` or `--nodes=<node1>,<node2>`.

```console
//
// See prefixes of a current node (node1)
//

$ breeze kvstore prefixes

> node1 prefixes
da00:cafe:babe:f6:f70b::/80
fc00:cafe:babe::1/128
192.168.0.1/32

//
// See adjacencies of node3
//

$ breeze kvstore adj --nodes=node3

> node3 adjacencies, version: 4, Node Label: 43049, Overloaded?: False

#### Inspect KvStore Content

More fun with KvStore. Read-write operations on replicated datastore via breeze
CLI.

- List keys in KvStore. Print all keys along with their TTL information.

```console
$ breeze kvstore keys --ttl

Key                   OriginatorId      Version  TTL (HH:MM:SS)      TTL Version

```

- List specific key-values

```console
$ breeze kvstore keyvals nodeLabel:1

> nodeLabel:1 ---
00000000: 01 00 00 00                                       ....
```

- Add some custom key

```console
// Set key with 60 seconds validity
$ breeze kvstore set-key test-key test-value --version=1 --ttl=60
Success: Set key test-key with version 1 and ttl 60000 successfully in KvStore.
This does not guarantee that value is updated in KvStore as old value can be
persisted back
```

- Get the key we just set

```console
$ breeze kvstore keys --prefix=test-key --ttl

Key       OriginatorId      Version  TTL (HH:MM:SS)      TTL Version
--------  --------------  ---------  ----------------  -------------
test-key  breeze                  1  0:01:00                       1

$ breeze kvstore keyvals test-key

> test-key --- test-value
```

- Override the old value with a new one with a higher version

```console
$ breeze kvstore set-key test-key test-value --version=2 --ttl=60
Success: Set key test-key with version 1 and ttl 60000 successfully in KvStore.
This does not guarantee that value is updated in KvStore as old value can be
persisted back

$ breeze kvstore keyvals test-key

> test-key --- new-test-value
```

- Erase key from KvStore. It is performed by setting TTL of the key to zero.

> NOTE: You shouldn't try to erase keys originated by Open/R NOTE: Erase only
> happens on all nodes reachable from the current node. Any node momentarily
> disconnected from the network might bring back the key you just erased.

```console
$ breeze kvstore erase-key test-key
Success: key test-key will be erased soon from all KvStores.
```

#### KvStore Compare

Get the delta between contents of two KvStores. By default, the command will
compare each pair of nodes in the network. It will output nothing if the
kvstores are synced between nodes. There should be no difference if nodes are
part of the same network.

```console
$ breeze kvstore kv-compare --nodes='fc00:cafe:babe::3'
dumped kv from fc00:cafe:babe::3
```

#### KvStore Signature

Returns a signature of the contents of the KV store for comparison with other
nodes. In case of a mismatch, use `kv-compare` to analyze differences.

```console
$ breeze kvstore kv-signature
sha256: d0bd6722917451be2f56a9b1e720ecffeb7e45f9c0e842d62dc90c1d047d870f
```

#### Peers

The KvStore of a node is connected to the KvStores of all immediate neighbors.
All updates are flooded via PUB/SUB channels between these stores and they
guarantee eventual consistency of data on all nodes. This command shows
information about a node's KvStore peers and details of the connections.

```console
$ breeze kvstore peers

== node1's peers  ==

Peer    State        Address                               Port  Area
------  -----------  ----------------------------------  ------  ------------------
node2   INITIALIZED  fe80::2421:5ff:fe42:f9e%if_1_2_1      2018  non-default-areaId
node5   INITIALIZED  fe80::3c7f:72ff:fec4:497c%if_1_5_1    2018  non-default-areaId
```

#### Snoop

Live snooping on KV-store updates in the network.

```console
$ breeze -H 2401:db00:2120:20ed:feed::1 kvstore snoop

> Key: test-key update
version:         -->  1
originatorId:    -->  breeze

> Key: test-key update
version:  1  -->  2

> Key: test-key got expired

...
```

Live snooping on KV-store updates in the network with filter specified.

```console
$ breeze kvstore snoop -r "adj:" -r "prefix" -c "node1" -c "node2" --match-all -r "test"

Timestamp: 2020-09-10 09:08:01.734

```

#### Kvstore Validate

Runs the following checks:

- The target node is advertising at least one adj key and one prefix key from
  its local kvstore. On failure this check will print out the advertisement
  status of both types of keys.
- All peers are in the `INITIALIZED` state. On failure this check will print out
  information about peers which are not in the `INITIALIZED` state:
- All keys in the target node's local kvstore have a TTL above 3/4 of the
  defined maximum TTL. On failure, print out information about keys which have a
  TTL below 3/4 of the defined maximum.
- The `KVSTORE_SYNCED` initialization event has been published within a time
  limit. On failure, an error message will indicate whether the check failed
  because the initialization event has not been published, or if it was
  published but exceeded acceptable time limits. Output if all checks pass:

```console
$ breeze kvstore validate
[Kvstore] Prefix And Adjacency Key Advertisement Check: PASS
[Kvstore] Peer State Check: PASS
[Kvstore] Key Ttl Check: PASS
Configured Time-To-Live(TTL): 3600000ms, Threshold to alarm: 2700000ms
[Kvstore] Initialization Event Check: PASS
Time elapsed for event, KVSTORE_SYNCED, since Open/R started: 2566ms
```

Output if all checks fail:

```console

```

#### Validate

- Checks if the RIB_COMPUTED initialization event has been published within
  acceptable time limits. In the case of failure prints out whether or not the
  event has been published
- For each of the configured areas of the target node, checks if the adj and
  prefix table for kvstore and decision match. If the check fails, prints out
  entries which are in one db but not the other.

```console
$ breeze decision validate
[Decision] Initialization Event Check: PASS
Time elapsed for event, RIB_COMPUTED, since Open/R started: 2566ms
[Decision] Running validation checks on area: non-default-areaId
[Decision] Adj Table For Decision And Kvstore Match Check: PASS
[Decision] Prefix Table For Decision And Kvstore Match Check: PASS
```

### LinkMonitor Commands

---

#### links

Open/R discovers local interfaces of a node (based on specified regular
expressions) and monitors their status via asynchronous Netlink APIs. It also
performs neighbor discovery on learned links.

```console
$ breeze lm links

Interface    Status    Overloaded    Metric Override    ifIndex    Addresses
-----------  --------  ------------  -----------------  ---------  -------------------------
if_1_2_0     Up                                         6          172.16.0.0
                                                                   fe80::c2f:5bff:fe9a:1cdc
if_1_3_0     Up                                         7          172.16.0.2
                                                                   fe80::90be:bbff:fe2b:d4f7
```

#### set/unset link metric

Set/unset custom metric value for a link.

- Set custom link metric on one link and drain another link

> NOTE: Setting link overload will make link completely unusable for routing
> while setting a high value as the link metric will make the link less
> preferable, mimicking hard-drain and soft-drain behavior respectively.

```console
$ breeze lm set-link-metric if_1_2_0 5

Are you sure to set override metric for interface if_1_2_0 ? [yn] y
Successfully set override metric for the interface.

$ breeze lm set-link-overload aq_1_3_0

Are you sure to set overload bit for interface aq_1_3_0 ? [yn] y
```

- List links

```console
$ breeze lm links

Interface    Status    Overloaded    Metric Override    ifIndex    Addresses
-----------  --------  ------------  -----------------  ---------  -------------------------
if_1_2_0     Up                      5                  6          172.16.0.0
                                                                   fe80::c2f:5bff:fe9a:1cdc
if_1_3_0     Up        True                             7          172.16.0.2
                                                                   fe80::90be:bbff:fe2b:d4f7
```

- Undo changes with unset operation

```console
$ breeze lm unset-link-metric if_1_2_0

Are you sure to unset override metric for interface if_1_2_0 ? [yn] y
Successfully unset override metric for the interface.

$ breeze lm unset-link-overload if_1_3_0

Successfully unset overload status of the interface.
```

#### set/unset node overload

Setting node overload will maintain reachability to/from this node but it will
not use the node for transit traffic.

- Set node overload

```console
$ breeze lm set-node-overload

Are you sure to set overload bit for node node1 ? [yn] y
Successfully set overload bit..
```

- See that it is reflected in its adjacency DB

```console
$ breeze kvstore adj

> node1 adjacencies, version: 10, Node Label: 41983, Overloaded?: True
Neighbor    Local Interface    Remote Interface      Metric    Weight    Adj Label  NextHop-v4    NextHop-v6                 Uptime
node2       if_1_2_0           if_2_1_0                   1         1        50006  172.16.0.1    fe80::e0fd:b7ff:fe23:e73f  1h51m
node3       if_1_3_0           if_3_1_0                   1         1        50007  172.16.0.3    fe80::ecf4:d3ff:fef1:4cb6  1h51m
```

- Unset node overload

```console
$ breeze lm unset-node-overload

Are you sure to unset overload bit for node node1 ? [yn] y
Successfully unset overload bit..
```

#### Validate

- Checks if the `LINK_DISCOVERED` initialization event has been published within
  acceptable time limits. If the check fails, prints whether or not the event
  has been published
- For each interface, checks if it matches atleast one inclusion regex of any
  configured area, and does not match any exclusion regexes. If the interface
  does not match any inclsuion regex, checks if it matches the redistribution
  interface regex. On failure prints out information about the interfaces which
  fail these qualifications

```console
$ breeze lm validate
[Link Monitor] Initialization Event Check: PASS
Time elapsed for event, LINK_DISCOVERED, since Open/R started: 565ms
[Link Monitor] Interface Regex Check: PASS
```

### PrefixManager Commands

PrefixManager exposes APIs to list, advertise and withdraw prefixes into the
network for the current node.

#### advertise/withdraw

- Advertise a prefix from this node.

```console
$ breeze prefixmgr advertise face:b00c::/64
Advertised face:b00c::/64
```

- Sync routes with new list of routes of a given type (BREEZE here)

```console
$ breeze prefixmgr sync face:b00c::/80
Synced 1 prefixes with type BREEZE
```

#### List Advertised Routes

- List advertised prefixes by current node

```console
$ breeze prefixmgr advertised-routes all

Markers: * - One of the best entries, @ - The best entry
Acronyms: SP - Source Preference, PP - Path Preference, D - Distance
          MN - Min-Nexthops

   Source                               FwdAlgo      FwdType  SP     PP     D      MN

> 2803:6081:2874::/46, 1/1
*@ BGP                                  SP_ECMP      SR_MPLS  100    1000   2      24

> 2401:db00:106c:1d00::/56, 1/1
*@ BGP                                  SP_ECMP      SR_MPLS  100    1000   2      24
```

- Withdraw advertised routes

```console
$ breeze prefixmgr withdraw face:b00c::/80
Withdrew face:b00c::/80
```

> NOTE: You can use different a prefix-type while advertising/syncing routes
> with the `--prefix-type` option

#### Validate

- Checks if the `PREFIX_DB_SYNCED` initialization event has been published

```console
$ breeze prefixmgr validate
[Prefixmanager] Initialization Event Check: PASS
Time elapsed for event, PREFIX_DB_SYNCED, since Open/R started: 2567ms
```

### Config Commands

---

Config is stored as opaque key-values on the disk. Here are APIs to read and
update it.

#### List configs of various modules

- Dump link monitor config.

```console
$ breeze config link-monitor
== Link monitor parameters stored ==

> isOverloaded: Yes

> nodeLabel: 5

> overloadedLinks: aq_2, aq_1

> linkMetricOverrides:

```

- Dump prefix allocation config.

```console
$ breeze config prefix-allocator

== Prefix Allocator parameters stored  ==

> Seed prefix: 49.50.51.52/128

> Allocated prefix length: 80

> Allocated prefix index: 80
```

- Dump prefix manager config.

```console
$ breeze config prefix-manager

== Prefix Manager parameters stored  ==

fc00:cafe:babe::3/128
da00:cafe:babe:94:4634::/80

```

#### Store/Erase configs manually (Not so useful commands)

- Erase a config key.

```console
$ breeze config erase prefix-manager-config
Key erased
```

- Store a config key.

```console
$ breeze config store prefix-allocator-config /tmp/config
Key stored
```

### Monitor Commands

---

#### counters

Fetch and display Open/R counters. You can programmatically fetch these counters
periodically via Monitor client and export them for monitoring purposes.

```console
$ breeze monitor counters --prefix decision

decision.adj_db_update.count.0 : 16.0
decision.adj_db_update.count.3600 : 7.0
decision.adj_db_update.count.60 : 0.0
decision.adj_db_update.count.600 : 0.0
decision.path_build_runs.count.0 : 30.0
decision.path_build_runs.count.3600 : 22.0
decision.path_build_runs.count.60 : 0.0
decision.path_build_runs.count.600 : 0.0
decision.prefix_db_update.count.0 : 10.0
decision.prefix_db_update.count.3600 : 3.0
decision.prefix_db_update.count.60 : 0.0
decision.prefix_db_update.count.600 : 0.0
decision.spf.multipath_ms.avg.0 : 0.0
decision.spf.multipath_ms.avg.3600 : 0.0
decision.spf.multipath_ms.avg.60 : 0.0
decision.spf.multipath_ms.avg.600 : 0.0
decision.spf_runs.count.0 : 78.0
decision.spf_runs.count.3600 : 66.0
decision.spf_runs.count.60 : 0.0
decision.spf_runs.count.600 : 0.0
```

### FIB Commands

---

FIB is the only platform-specific part of Open/R. FibAgent runs as a separate
service on the node which is primarily responsible for managing the routing
tables on the node. Breeze also exposes commands to interact with FibAgent.

#### List/Add/Delete route via breeze!

> NOTE: You don't need to do this but they are just for fun!

This command only shows how to `add/del` routes. You can instead use the `sync`
command to replace all existing routing entries with newly specified routes.

- List routes

```console
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib routes-installed

== leb01.labdca1's FIB routes ==

> 10.127.253.2/32
via 10.254.112.129@Port-Channel1201

> 2620:0:1cff:dead:bef1:ffff:ffff:2/128
via fe80::21c:73ff:fe3c:e50c@Port-Channel1201
```

- Add new route

```console
# add route
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib add '192.168.0.0/32' '1.3.4.5@Port-Channel1201'
192.168.0.0 32
Added 1 routes.

# list routes
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib routes-installed

== leb01.labdca1's FIB routes ==

> 10.127.253.2/32
via 10.254.112.129@Port-Channel1201

> 192.168.0.0/32
via 1.3.4.5@Port-Channel1201

> 2620:0:1cff:dead:bef1:ffff:ffff:2/128
via fe80::21c:73ff:fe3c:e50c@Port-Channel1201
```

- Delete existing routes

```console
# delete routes
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib del '192.168.0.0/32'
192.168.0.0 32
Deleted 1 routes.

// list routes
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib routes-installed

== leb01.labdca1's FIB routes ==

> 10.127.253.2/32
via 10.254.112.129@Port-Channel1201

> 2620:0:1cff:dead:bef1:ffff:ffff:2/128
via fe80::21c:73ff:fe3c:e50c@Port-Channel1201
```

#### Syncing routes

You can use sync API to synchronize routing table with fresh routing table
entries.

```console
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib routes-installed

== leb01.labdca1's FIB routes ==

> 10.127.253.2/32
via 10.254.112.129@Port-Channel1201

> 2620:0:1cff:dead:bef1:ffff:ffff:2/128
via fe80::21c:73ff:fe3c:e50c@Port-Channel1201


$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib sync '' ''
Reprogrammed FIB with 0 routes.
$ breeze -H leb01.labdca1 fib routes-installed

== leb01.labdca1's FIB routes ==
```

#### Validation for platforms routes checking

One can `validate` command to validate if the platform (e.g. kernel routing
table) has all the routes that Open/R intended to program. In case of a
mismatch, the discrepancies will be reported to help debugging.

```console
$ breeze fib validate
PASS
Fib and Kernel routing table match
```

An example of reporting discrepancy

```console
$ breeze fib validate
FAIL
Fib and Kernel routing table do not match
Routes in kernel but not in Fib

> fc00:cafe:babe::999/128
via fe80::1@terra_241_3
```

### Spark Commands

#### graceful-restart

Sends a yes/no prompt, then gracefully restarts, sending a notifying message

```console
$ breeze spark graceful-restart
Are you sure to force sending GR msg to neighbors? [yn] y
Successfully forcing to send GR msgs.

```

#### neighbors

prints information about all discovered neighbors of the local node

```console
$ breeze spark neighbors


 Neighbor    State        Latest Event    Local Intf    Remote Intf    Area                  Rtt(us)
----------  -----------  --------------  ------------  -------------  ------------------  ---------
node2       ESTABLISHED  HANDSHAKE_RCVD  if_1_2_3      if_2_1_3       non-default-areaId       1000
node2       ESTABLISHED  HANDSHAKE_RCVD  if_1_2_2      if_2_1_2       non-default-areaId       1000
node2       ESTABLISHED  HANDSHAKE_RCVD  if_1_2_1      if_2_1_1       non-default-areaId       1000
node5       ESTABLISHED  HANDSHAKE_RCVD  if_1_5_1      if_5_1_1       non-default-areaId       1000
node5       ESTABLISHED  HANDSHAKE_RCVD  if_1_5_3      if_5_1_3       non-default-areaId       1000
node5       ESTABLISHED  HANDSHAKE_RCVD  if_1_5_2      if_5_1_2       non-default-areaId       1000
```

#### validate

- Checks if all discovered neighbors are in `ESTABLISHED` state. On failure,
  prints information about neighbors which are not
- Checks if all neighbors match at least one neighbor regex defined in the
  configured areas of the local node
- Checks if the `NEIGHBOR_DISCOVERED` initialization event has been published
  within acceptable time limits

```console
$ breeze spark validate
[Spark] Neighbor State Check: PASS
Total Neighbors: 6, Neigbors in ESTABLISHED State: 6, Neighbors in Other States: 0
[Spark] Initialization Event Check: PASS
Time elapsed for event, NEIGHBOR_DISCOVERED, since Open/R started: 2566ms
[Spark] Neighbor Regex Matching Check: PASS
Neighbor Regexes: {'non-default-areaId': ['.*']}
```
