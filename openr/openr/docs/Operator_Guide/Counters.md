# Counters and Log Events

Each module internally generates its own list of counters using the `ThreadData`
library (which has supports for stats like SUM/RATE/COUNT over various
durations). These counters are periodically submitted to the `Monitor` store
(singleton) via replicate queue called `LogSampleQueue`. A Monitoring agent on
the node or remotely can connect to `Monitor` and query the counters to perform
monitoring on the top of these counters or build interactive dashboards.

Further, each module logs important events like `IFACE_UP` or `NEIGHBOR_DOWN` in
a structured fashion via Monitor which can be logged to data stores like `Druid`
to do real-time monitoring of log events across the fleet.

## Understanding Counters

---

Counters are exported as key-value pairs where the key is string and value is a
64-bit integer. Keys represent either a plain counter like a number of neighbors
or statistic like the number of SPF computations in last one minute. Stats are
encoded with the following method:

`<module-name>.<counter-name>.<stat-type>.<seconds>`

For example:

- `kvstore.received_key_vals.sum.60` represents number of key-value updates that
  happened in past one minute
- `decision.spf_runs.count.3600` represents number of SPF runs in last one hour
- `decision.spf.multipath_ms.avg.0` represents the average execution time across
  all SPF calculations

### Important Counters to Monitor

---

Here are some important counters to monitor for a production system and alert
engineers quickly if something goes wrong. `breeze monitor counters` will list a
lot of other counters as well. Most names are self-explanatory.

#### KvStore Counters

- `kvstore.num_keys` => This counter shouldn't exceed a certain threshold and
  must have some max limit for a given network. If the number of keys keeps
  increasing in KvStore that means the system will soon run out of memory
- `kvstore.peers` => Usually every node in a network must have at least one peer
- `kvstore.pending_full_sync` => Pending full sync request to a neighbor, this
  counter should be 0 most of time

#### Spark Counters

- `spark.num_tracked_interfaces` => Indicates the number of interfaces learned
  by OpenR
- `spark.num_adjacent_neighbors` must match with `spark.num_tracked_neighbors`
  as eventually adjacency must form between all connected nodes in the domain

#### Decision Counters

- `decision.adj_db_update.count.60` shouldn't exceed a certain threshold. A
  higher number indicates an instable network
- `decision.prefix_db_update.count.60` shouldn't exceed a certain threshold.
  Higher number indicates a lot of churn in route advertisement
- `decision.spf_runs.count.60` a higher number indicates a lot of network churn
  (corresponds to adj_db_update).

#### Fib Counters

- `fib.convergence_time_ms.avg.60` indicates average convergece time for all
  events in last one minute.
- `fib.num_routes` should correspond to number of unique advertised prefixes
  across all nodes

#### Link Monitor Counters

- `link_monitor.advertise_adjacencies.sum.60` => higher number indicates a lot
  of adjacency flapping
- `link_monitor.advertise_links.sum.60` => higher number indicates a lot of link
  flapping on system

## Log Events

---

Along with counters OpenR also publishes certain log events. Each log event is a
json sample described as dictionary of

`<value-type> => map<key, value>`

Each sample has following keys along with more information

- `int` key named `time` indicating timestamp since epoch in number of seconds.
- `string` key named `domain` indicating network name
- `string` key named `name` indicating name of the node
- `string` key named `event` indicating event name

Some important evens names are:

- `ROUTE_CALC`
- `ROUTE_UPDATE`
- `NB_RTT_CHANGE`
- `KEY_EXPIRE`
- `IFACE_UPDATE`
- `IFACE_DOWN`
- `IFACE_UP`
- `DECISION_DEBOUNCE`
- `ROUTE_CONVERGENCE`
- `NB_UP`
- `NB_DOWN`
- `NB_RESTART`
- `ADD_PEER`
- `DEL_PEER`
