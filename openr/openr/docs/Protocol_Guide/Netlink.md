# Netlink C++ Interface

## Netlink Overview

---

Linux `Netlink` is a messaging system for intra-kernel as well as kernel and
user-space processes to program the Linux network forwarding stack. Networking
utilities like `iproute2` and `iptables` use `Netlink` to program and gather
networking information from the Linux Kernel. Introduced in RFC 3549, `Netlink`
is a more flexible successor to `ioctl`. `ioctl` used system calls to program
and poll the kernel for updates, however, `Netlink` is asynchronous and supports
multicast communication: multiple user-space processes can listen to updates
from the kernel. To program the kernel, a process can send a Netlink message(s)
to the Linux socket and listen to responses.

## Introduction

---

Each Netlink packet comprises of one or more Netlink messages. Each Netlink
message has a header

```sh
struct nlmsghdr {
    __u32 nlmsg_len;    /* Length of message including header */
    __u16 nlmsg_type;   /* Type of message content */
    __u16 nlmsg_flags;  /* Additional flags */
    __u32 nlmsg_seq;    /* Sequence number */
    __u32 nlmsg_pid;    /* Sender port ID */
};
```

This library provides C++ APIs to interact with kernel for networking state via
netlink protocol. The functionality is intentionally kept minimal to the needs
of Open/R, but it can be extended. In Open/R, we primarily use the
`NETLINK_ROUTE` family to manage the links, addresses, neighbor and route
entries. `nlmsghdr.nlmsg_type` reflects the type of the Netlink operation. Based
on the type of the message, each message has an ancillary netlink header whose
fields on dependent on the type of the operation. Each message can also have a
bunch of attributes and sub-attributes (mainly used for multiple next-hops for
ECMP/UCMP). Below we describe the organization of code in this directory. Refer
to inline code documentation in header files for more information.

## Deep Dive

### NetlinkTypes

Defines C++ classes to represent various routing information e.g. Address, Link,
Route etc. This serves as data representation between application code and
netlink C++ library.

### NetlinkMessageBase

Defines base class that facilitates serialization and de-serialization of
message exchange with linux kernel.

Reference: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html

### Addr/Link/Neighbor/Route

Specialization of netlink message for `NETLINK_ROUTE` (aka rtnetlink) family. It
implements Addresses, Link, Neighbor and Route (IP, IPv6 & MPLS).

Reference: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtnetlink.7.html

For example, a sample message layout of `RTM_NEWROUTE` will be like:

### NetlinkProtocolSocket

Implements send and receive netlink messages with the use of `AF_NETLINK` socket
type. Also provides public APIs to get/add/del for Addresses, Link, Neighbor and
Routes.

### Unit Testing

Netlink code is exhaustively unit-tested. However to run unit-tests, you'll need
to run with `sudo`. Temporary route, link, address and neighbor entries will be
created in the network. Hence it is best to run inside the container

For MPLS route unit-tests you'll need to have MPLS enabled kernel with following
sysctl configuration parameters.

Some unit-tests tries to add upto 100k routes and can consume significant amount
of memory and time to run. So please be patient or disable those tests if you
don't want your system to scale to that number.

```
// Install kernel modules
sudo modprobe mpls_router
sudo modprobe mpls_iptunnel
sudo modprobe mpls_gso

// Configure sysctl
sysctl -w net.mpls.platform_labels=65536
```
