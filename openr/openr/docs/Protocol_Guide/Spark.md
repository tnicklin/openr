# Spark - Neighbor Discovery

## Introduction

---

`Spark` is the neighbor discovery module of Open/R. It leverages IPv6 link-local
multicast via UDP socket to discover and maintain adjacencies, aka "Neighbor
Relationships". The discovered neighbors, aka "Local Topology" of the node, is
fed into the system for KvStore database synchronization, and SPF Computation.

## Inter Module Communication

- `[Producer] ReplicateQueue<NeighborInitEvent>`: sends out neighbor events via
  `NeighborUpdatesQueue` to `LinkMonitor`, which includes:
  `UP`/`DOWN`/`RESTART`/`RTT-CHANGE` events or InitializationEvent
  `NEIGHBOR_DISCOVERED`.

- `[Consumer] RQueue<thrift::InterfaceDatabase>`: receives interface database
  update via `InterfaceUpdatesQueue` from `LinkMonitor`. Neighbor discovery will
  be applied on those interfaces ONLY.

## Operations

---

`Spark` relies on `LinkMonitor` for interface and address notifications of the
underlying system. Then states and timers will decide which types of packet to
be periodically sent. See **Module Deep Dive** for details. Upon link event,
corresponding interfaces will be modified inside database:

- Interface UP: start performing neighbor discovery and record neighbor state;
- Interface DOWN: remove tracked neighbor over this interface and generate
  neighbor down notification;

## Areas

Spark only forms adjacencies with nodes in the same area. This is configured in
the `area` stanza of the Open/R config. For example, the following node is in
two areas:

```json
"areas": [
  {
    "area_id": "area1",
    "include_interface_regexes": [
      "eth[0-9]"
    ],
  },
  {
    "area_id": "area2",
    "include_interface_regexes": [
      "eth[0-9]"
    ],
  }
],
```

### Wildcard Area

Open/R has a special area that is treated as the wildcard area. This is area
**"0"**. Interfaces configured into this area will form adjacencies with any
other node not validating what area they claim to be in. Example Config:

```json
"areas": [
  {
    "area_id": "0",
    "include_interface_regexes": [
      "eth0"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Spark Packet

`Spark` communicates to peer spark instance by broadcasting a UDP packet to
link-local multicast address `ff02::1`. The packet is sent over every configured
interface. The content of the packet evolves as neighboring spark instances
starts to learn about each other.

The content of the packet is a serialized thrift object of type `SparkPacket`.
This internally consists of three main messages as its attributes. There will be
only one of them populated at a time to reduce control plane traffic.

- `SparkHelloMsg`
- `SparkHandshakeMsg`
- `SparkHeartbeatMsg`

> NOTE: By using thrift serialization/deserialization we completely avoid the
> encoding and decoding complexity of data exchange. Thrift further provides a
> good backward compatibility support as message structure evolves.

Check out
[if/Types.thrift](https://github.com/facebook/openr/blob/master/openr/if/Types.thrift)
for detailed message structure.

High level speaking:

- `SparkHelloMsg` => Sent out periodically over all configured interfaces. It
  broadcasts discovered neighbor advertisements and future neighbor
  solicitation.
- `SparkHandshakeMsg` => Negotiation message to establish neighbor relationship,
  aka the `Adjacency`. Similar to TCP 3-way handshake process. Negotiation
  includes version, timers, and area configuration that we'll discuss below.
- `SparkHeartbeatMsg` => Send out peridodically for keep-alive purpose.

### Finite State Machine

![State Transition Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51382140/90571412-899e7b00-e166-11ea-97bd-419b493846cf.png)

`Spark` leverages Finite State Machine (FSM) to formulate neighbor state and its
transitions on event. FSM formulation ensures the correctness of state handling
and also greatly simplify the complexity of implementation.

```
SparkNeighState
- IDLE
- WARM
- NEGOTIATE
- ESTABLISHED
- RESTART

SparkNeighEvent
- HELLO_RCVD_INFO           => SparkHelloMsg received with node's self-info inside
- HELLO_RCVD_NO_INFO        => SparkHelloMsg received without node's self-info inside;
- HELLO_RCVD_RESTART        => neighbor going down and signal for GR;
- HEARTBEAT_RCVD            => keep alive msg received to refresh hold timer;
- HANDSHAKE_RCVD            => handshake acknowledgement;
- HEARTBEAT_TIMER_EXPIRE    => hold time expired;
- NEGOTIATE_TIMER_EXPIRE    => negotiate procedure timed out;
- GR_TIMER_EXPIRE           => graceful restart timer expired;
- NEGOTIATION_FAILURE       => negotiate procedure failed(e.g. area negotiation failure);
```

### SparkHelloMsg

- `SparkHelloMsg` contains node name, and the list of neighbors it has heard
  from on this interface. This allows ALL neighbors on a segment to agree on
  bidirectional visibility;
- Functionality:
  1. To advertise its own existence and basic neighbor information;
  2. To ask for immediate response for quick adjacency establishment;
  3. To notify for its own "RESTART" to neighbors;
- `SparkHelloMsg` is sent per interface;

### SparkHandshakeMsg

- `SparkHandshakeMsg` contains rest of necessary params to establish adjacency
  with neighbor besides what has been learned from `SparkHelloMsg`;
- Functionality:
  1. Exchange `peerAddr` and `port` info for peer to establish TCP connection;
  2. areaId neogtiation;
  3. hold time and GR time negotiation;
- `SparkHandshakeMsg` is sent per (interface, neighbor) combination;

> NOTE: `SparkHandshakeMsg` has destination node attribute. Neighbors on the
> same interface will ignore this message if it is NOT destined to itself.

### SparkHeartbeatMsg

- `SparkHeartbeatMsg` contains node name, sequence number;
- Functionality: notify its own aliveness
- `SparkHeartbeatMsg` is sent per interface;

### Timers

To maintain the state machine running smoothly, there are different kinds of
timers used.

1. `helloTimer`: timer to control frequency of helloMsg. It is set **per
   ifName**;
2. `negotiateTimer`: timer to control frequency of handshakeMsg. It is set **per
   neighbor**;
3. `heartbeatTimer`: timer to control frequency of heartbeatMsg. It is set **per
   ifName**;
4. `heartbeatHoldTimer`: maximum hold time for neighbor adjacency.
   `SparkHeartbeatMsg` will extend it;
5. `negotiateHoldTimer`: maximum time within `NEGOTIATE` state to avoid high
   volume of negotiate packets being sent;
6. `gracefulRestartHoldTimer`: maximum time to hold neighbor adjacency under GR;

For typical configuration of above timer, please refer to `SparkConfig` section
defined in

- [if/OpenrConfig.thrift](https://github.com/facebook/openr/blob/master/openr/if/OpenrConfig.thrift)

### Area Configuration

As area negotiation happens by default between spark instances, neighbor
adjacency will ONLY be formed if they can reach agreement on area.

For instance, nodeA and nodeB negotiates with area over `ethernet1`.

```
On nodeA:
AreaConfig = {
    area_id : "1",
    interface_regexes : ["ethernet1, port-channel.*"],
    neighbor_regexes : ["nodeB"]
}
```

```
On nodeB:
AreaConfig = {
    area_id : "1",
    interface_regexes : ["ethernet1, port-channel.*"],
    neighbor_regexes : ["nodeA"]
}
```

Both nodes will apply combination of `neighbor_regex`(i.e. regex for node_name)
and `interface_regex`(i.e. interface on which neighbor is discovered) to
identify what area neighbor should fall into. With above example, both nodeA and
nodeB think neighbor should be in area `1`. Hence the negotiation will go
through.

> NOTE: negotiation failure will trigger state transition from `NEGOTIATE` to
> `WARM` and stop sending `SparkHandshakeMsg`. See FSM transition part for
> deatils.

### RTT Measurement

With spark exchanging multicast packets for neighbor discovery we can easily
deduce the RTT between neighbors (reflection time). To reduce noise in RTT
measurements we use `Kernel Timestamps`. To avoid noisy `RTT_CHANGED` events we
use `StepDetector` so that small changes in RTT measurements are ignored.

### Fast Neighbor Discovery

When a node starts or a new link comes up, we perform fast initial neighbor
discovery by sending `SparkHelloMsg` with `solicitResponse` bit set. This is to
request immediate reply, which allows quicker discovery of new
neighbors(configurable).
