Open Routing
==================================

Open Routing, Open/R, is Facebook's internally designed and developed routing
platform. It is built upon the concepts of Link State routing and supports
routing use-cases of closed network. Its design, flexibility, and supported
functionalities has led to its adoption in Facebook's Data Center, Express
Backbone (WAN), and Terragraph (wireless) networks.
